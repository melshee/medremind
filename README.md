# medremind

*Inspiration*<br>
Recently being sick and having to keep track of medications has impacted our own lives and we felt that there must be a better way to make sure the medication we need is readily available and safe to use.

*What it does*<br>
MEDremind allows users to easily keep track of their prescription medication from tracking daily intake to getting reminders for expired medication and refill needs. Each account allows many users so family can help track medication needs for elder parents or young children. The daily tracker also sends text notifications to remind users at the appropriate times and to keep them accountable.
